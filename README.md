# Counter-Strike Mine-Offensive
A Spigot plugin.

####What is it?
As you can see, it is a counter-strike attempt on spigot without any client mods. The aim is to practice making spigot plugin, and, at the same time, write an awesome plugin.

####How does it work? Can I use it?
It works just like normal plugins, you just put the compiled jar (currently not attached) to plugins folder. At the moment, we're still trying to make the plugin pretty much usable/playable (it is **currently not playable**). You're free to use it, but use it at your own risks.

####This plugin sounds awesome, when will it be playable?
We don't know. We're just some random students with daily activities, so we usually work after school, except for weekends and/or national day off. If you've experience with Java and spigot plugin development, we might welcome you to make the process faster.

####Can you add X into this plugin?
If it is currently not in our TODO or it's not already there, probably yes.

####I am a Minecraft Server owner. Can I buy your plugin?
We won't sell it, but you're free to use it. And, before you ask, no, we can **NOT** be hired.

####I am (also) a Minecraft Server owner, can I ask you to make plugin to do X?
We're open to any suggestion, including this. If your idea is good enough, we (or just I) will probably try to make it.

####Can you give me the working plugin, privately? Please?
Nope.

####Can you teach me how to code?
We don't think our coding skill/style is good enough to teach others, so...

####I don't think you're using git the right way / I think your coding syntax is not acceptable...
We're still newbs at this, but we're trying to learn from experiences, so you can tell us by PM or any other means.

####I have other questions, where/whom should I ask?
You can contact us at facebook. (Link Attatched)
